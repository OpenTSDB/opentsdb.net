<h2>Schema</h2>

Each data point is stored independently in its own cell in HBase.  The row key
is composite and is made of: the metric ID, a timestamp, the tags.  Each tag
is made of a tag name ID and a tag value ID.

<p/>
For instance, if you have the following data point:
<div class="code">myservice.latency.avg 1292148123 42 reqtype=foo host=web42
</div>
And the metric ID for <code>myservice.latency.avg</code> is
<code>[0, 0, -69]</code>, the tag name ID for <code>reqtype</code> is
<code>[0, 0, 1]</code>, the tag value ID for <code>foo</code> is
<code>[0, 1, 11]</code>, the tag name ID for <code>host</code> is
<code>[0, 0, 2]</code> and the tag value ID for <code>web42</code> is
<code>[0, -7, 42]</code>, then you'd have the following row key:
<div class="code"><!--
     -->[0, 0, -69, 77, 4, -99, 32, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 11, 0, 0, 2, 0, -7, 42]
<!-- --> `-------'  `------------'  `-----'  `------'  `-----'  `-------'
<!-- --> metric ID  base timestamp  name ID  value ID  name ID  value ID
<!-- -->                            `---------------'  `---------------'
<!-- -->                                first tag         second tag
</div>
(note that the bytes for the timestamp are <code>[77, 4, -99, 32]</code> =
1292148000, because timestamps in the row key are rounded down to a
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/blob/25078599673e357c20f3ca0b354079141aaf1345/src/core/Const.java#L38">60
minute</a> boundary)

<p/>
Then the column qualifier for the value is on 2 bytes (16 bits).  The
first 12 bits are used to store an integer which is a delta in seconds
from the timestamp in the row key, and the remaining
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/blob/b2b9fac7e378b22f2e038bfb69f9baf724db782e/src/core/Const.java#L26">4 bits</a>
are flags.  In the example above, the data point is at time 1292148123 but
the timestamp in the row key is 1292148000, so the delta is 123.  The 4 bits
of flag are used as follows: the first bit indicates whether the value is an
integer value or a floating point value
(<a href="https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/blob/b2b9fac7e378b22f2e038bfb69f9baf724db782e/src/core/Const.java#L29"><code>Const.FLAG_FLOAT</code></a>),
the remaining 3 bits aren't really used at this time (as of 2010-12-21), but
they're reserved for variable-length encoding in the future.
<p/>
The value in the cell is the value of the data point itself, on 8 bytes.

<p/>
The code that adds new data to HBase is in
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/blob/master/src/core/IncomingDataPoints.java#L35"><code>core.IncomingDataPoints</code></a>,
so you can refer to this if you want to get down to the implementation
details.  You can also examine the raw contents of your table using the
<code>scan</code> <a href="cli.html">command-line tool</a>, for instance:

This output shows us the contents of 2 rows for the metric <code>test</code>
with a single tag <code>host=foo</code>, for a total of 14 + 2 = 16 data
points.  Each line that's indented by 2 spaces is a data point (stored in
its own cell in HBase).  The first 2-byte array is the qualifier, then the
8-byte array is the value.  The following integer is the delta decoded from
the qualifier, and then <code>l</code> indicates an integer value vs
<code>f</code> that indicates a floating point value.  Then there's the
value, and the timestamp of this value (which is equal to the base time
encoded in the row key + the delta) and the human readable version of the
timestamp.

<h3 id="reduced-overhead">Reducing HBase overhead</h3>
Note: As of OpenTSDB 1.0.0, this feature is disabled by default.  It will be
enabled by default in release 1.1.0.

<p/>
The problem with HBase's implementation is that every single cell also
stores the row key and a bunch of other redundant information.  In the
example above with 2 rows and 16 cells, the 13-byte row key is stored
16 times both on disk and in memory.  This leads to several scalability
problems, especially due to memory pressure inside Region Servers and
the increased number of objects that HBase has to handle.

<p/>
The idea here is simply to re-compact rows in background so that all the
values in a row would end up in one big cell, instead of being in many
individual cells.  For instance, this row containing 2 values:
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb scan 2010/11/07-23:00 sum test
[0, 0, -69, 76, -41, -94, 72, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -15] test 1289200200 (Sun Nov 07 23:10:00 PST 2010) {host=face}
  [3, -89] [108, 61]  58      l 27709 1289200258 (Sun Nov 07 23:10:58 PST 2010)
  [3, -73] [48, 125]  59      l 12413 1289200259 (Sun Nov 07 23:10:59 PST 2010)
</div>
Could be stored like so instead:
<div class="code">$ ./tsdb scan 2010/11/07-23:00 sum test
[0, 0, -69, 76, -41, -94, 72, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -15] test 1289200200 (Sun Nov 07 23:10:00 PST 2010) {host=face}
  [3, -89, 3, -73] [108, 61, 48, 125]  58      l 27709 1289200258 (Sun Nov 07 23:10:58 PST 2010)
                                       59      l 12413 1289200259 (Sun Nov 07 23:10:59 PST 2010)
</div>
Where both values are grouped together in a single cell.  The TSD can
continuously re-compact values in background.  New data points are still
need to be written to their own cell though, because HBase doesn't have
an "atomic append" operation, and doing read-modify-write is a lot more
expensive than just adding a new cell.  After a certain amount of time,
we know that a given row will probably not be changed ever again, so we
can do a single read-modify-write-delete to compact all the cells in that
row into a single bigger cell.

<p/>
This change can dramatically increase the speed of read queries as it forces
HBase to look at far fewer objects when scanning the table.  It also improves
memory usage in HBase, thus allowing for a better cache hit rate.

<p/>
To enable TSD compactions, add the following line to your
<code>tsdb.local</code>, in the same directory as the <code>tsdb</code>
executable script:
<div class="code">JVMARGS="$JVMARGS -Dtsd.feature.compactions=true"
</div>
If you wish to disable compactions, just set the value to <code>false</code>.

<h2 id="upcoming-changes">Upcoming changes</h2>
The following schema changes have been planned for Q1 2012:
<ul>
<li>Variable length encoding of all values.</li>
<li>Run-length encoding for duplicate values.</li>
</ul>
The newer TSDs will always be able to understand the current format
anyway, so no need to rewrite their entire TSDB table and no downtime
required to rollout the change.

<h3 id="vint">Variable length encoding</h3>
Both integer value and floating point values will be encoded on a variable
number of bytes (from 1 to 8).  For integer values, this is fairly
straightforward, using something inspired from
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/encoding.html#varints">Google's
<code>VarInt</code></a> or <code>GroupVarInt</code>.  For floating point
values, it's not as simple, but one possible candidate is an IEEE 754 style
encoding on fewer bytes with an acceptable upper bound on the loss of
precision.  2-byte floating point values are commonly known as "half
precision", but the idea can be used with any number of bytes (2 to 8).
With a single byte, a fixed-point representation can cover more useful
values than a floating-point one.

<p/>
Unlike Google's implementation though, the size of the values will be stored
in the qualifier, where there are 3 bits reserved already, as opposed to
being stored inside the value itself.  This will make decoding values faster
as it will require fewer bit shifts (compared to regular <code>VarInt</code>
at least).

<h3 id="rle">Run-Length Encoding (RLE)</h3>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">RLE</a> can be
used to very compactly store deltas.  This can be used for time deltas in
the column qualifiers as well as to store duplicate values.
