HBase Schema
============

Data Table Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All OpenTSDB data points are stored in a single, massive table, named ``tsdb`` by default. This is to take advantage of HBase's ordering and region distribution. All values are stored in the ``t`` column family.

**Row Key** - Row keys are byte arrays comprised of the metric UID, a base timestamp and the UID for tagk/v pairs:  ``<metric_uid><timestamp><tagk1><tagv1>[...<tagkN><tagvN>]``. By default, UIDs are encoded on 3 bytes. 

The timestamp is a Unix epoch value in seconds encoded on 4 bytes. Rows are broken up into hour increments, reflected by the timestamp in each row. Thus each timestamp will be normalized to an hour value, e.g. *2013-01-01 08:00:00*. This is to avoid stuffing too many data points in a single row as that would affect region distribution. Also, since HBase sorts on the row key, data for the same metric and time bucket, but with different tags, will be grouped together for efficient queries.

Some example row keys, represented as hex are:

::
  
  00000150E22700000001000001
  00000150E22700000001000001000002000004
  00000150E22700000001000002
  00000150E22700000001000003
  00000150E23510000001000001
  00000150E23510000001000001000002000004
  00000150E23510000001000002
  00000150E23510000001000003
  00000150E24320000001000001
  00000150E24320000001000001000002000004
  00000150E24320000001000002
  00000150E24320000001000003

where:

::
  
  00000150E22700000001000001
  '----''------''----''----'
  metric  time   tagk  tagv

This represents a single metric but four time series across three hours. Note how there is one time series with two sets of tags: 

::

  00000150E22700000001000001000002000004
  '----''------''----''----''----''----'
  metric  time   tagk  tagv  tagk  tagv
  
Tag names (tagk) are sorted alphabetically before storage, so the "host" tag will always appear first in the row key/TSUID ahead of "owner".

Data Point Columns
------------------

By far the most common column are data points. These are the actual values recorded when data is sent to the TSD for storage. 

**Column Qualifiers** - The qualifier is comprised of 2 or 4 bytes that encode an offset from the row's base time and flags to determine if the value is an integer or a decimal value. Qualifiers encode an offset from the row base time as well as the format and length of the data stored.

Columns with 2 byte qualifiers have an offset in seconds. The first 12 bits of the qualifier represent an integer that is a delta from the timestamp in the row key. For example, if the row key is normalized to ``1292148000`` and a data point comes in for ``1292148123``, the recorded delta will be ``123``. The last 4 bits are format flags

Columns with 4 byte qualifiers have an offset in milliseconds. The first 4 *bits* of the qualifier will always be set to ``1`` or ``F`` in hex. The next 22 bits encode the offset in milliseconds as an unsigned integer. The next 2 bits are reserved and the final 4 bits are format flags.

The last 4 bits of either column type describe the data stored. The first bit is a flag that indicates whether or not the value is an integer or floating point. A value of 0 indicates an integer, 1 indicates a float. The last 3 bits indicate the length of the data, offset by 1. A value of ``000`` indicates a 1 byte value while ``010`` indicates a 2 byte value. The length must reflect a value of 1, 2, 4 or 8. Anything else indicates an error.

For example, ``0100`` means the column value is an 8 byte, signed integer. ``1011`` indicates the column value is a 4 byte floating point value So the qualifier for the data point at ``1292148123`` with an integer value of 4294967296 would have a qualifier of ``0000011110110100`` or ``07B4`` in hex.

**Column Values** - 1 to 8 bytes encoded as indicated by the qualifier flag.

Compactions
-----------

If compactions have been enabled for a TSD, a row may be compacted after it's base hour has passed or a query has run over the row. Compacted columns simply squash all of the data points together to reduce the amount of overhead consumed by disparate data points. Data is initially written to individual columns for speed, then compacted later for storage efficiency. Once a row is compacted, the individual data points are deleted. Data may be written back to the row and compacted again later.

.. Note:: The OpenTSDB compaction process is entirely separate in scope and definition than the HBase idea of compactions.

**Column Qualifiers** - The qualifier for a compacted column will always be an even number of bytes and is simply a concatenation of the qualifiers for every data point that was in the row. Since we know each data point qualifier is 2 bytes, it's simple to split this up. A qualifier in hex with 2 data points may look like ``07B407D4``.

**Column Values** - The value is also a concatenation of all of the individual data points. The qualifier is split first and the flags for each data point determine if the parser consumes 4 or 8 bytes 

Annotations or Other Objects
----------------------------

A row may store notes about the timeseries inline with the datapoints. Objects differ from data points by having an odd number of bytes in the qualifier.

**Column Qualifiers** - The qualifier is on 3 or 5 bytes with the first byte an ID that denotes the column as a qualifier. The first byte will always have a hex value of ``01`` for annotations (future object types will have a different prefix). The remaining bytes encode the timestamp delta from the row base time in a manner similar to a data point, though without the flags. If the qualifier is 3 bytes in length, the offset is in seconds. If the qualifier is 5 bytes in length, the offset is in milliseconds. Thus if we record an annotation at ``1292148123``, the delta will be ``123`` and the qualifier, in hex, will be ``01007B``. 

**Column Values** - Annotation values are UTF-8 encoded JSON objects. Do not modify this value directly. The order of the fields is important, affecting CAS calls. 

UID Table Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A separate, smaller table called ``tsdb-uid`` stores UID mappings, both forward and reverse. Two columns exist, one named ``name`` that maps a UID to a string and another ``id`` mapping strings to UIDs. Each row in the column family will have at least one of three columns with mapping values. The standard column qualifiers are:

* ``metrics`` for mapping metric names to UIDs
* ``tagk`` for mapping tag names to UIDs
* ``tagv`` for mapping tag values to UIDs.

The ``name`` family may also contain additional meta-data columns if configured.

``id`` Column Family
--------------------

**Row Key** - This will be the string assigned to the UID. E.g. for a metric we may have a value of ``sys.cpu.user`` or for a tag value it may be ``42``. 

**Column Qualifiers** - One of the standard column types above.

**Column Value** - An unsigned integer encoded on 3 bytes by default reflecting the UID assigned to the string for the column type. If the UID length has been changed in the source code, the width may vary.

``name`` Column Family
----------------------

**Row Key** - The unsigned integer UID encoded on 3 bytes by default. If the UID length has been changed in the source code, the width may be different.

**Column Qualifiers** - One of the standard column types above OR one of ``metrics_meta``, ``tagk_meta`` or ``tagv_meta``.

**Column Value** - For the standard qualifiers above, the string assigned to the UID. For a ``*_meta`` column, the value will be a UTF-8 encoded, JSON formatted UIDMeta Object as a string. Do not modify the column value outside of OpenTSDB. The order of the fields is important, affecting CAS calls.

UID Assignment Row
------------------

Within the ``id`` column family is a row with a single byte key of ``\x00``. This is the UID row that is incremented for the proper column type (metrics, tagk or tagv) when a new UID is assigned. The column values are 8 byte signed integers and reflect the maximum UID assigned for each type. On assignment, OpenTSDB calls HBase's atomic increment command on the proper column to fetch a new UID.

Meta Table Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This table is an index of the different time series stored in OpenTSDB and can contain meta-data for each series as well as the number of data points stored for each series. Note that data will only be written to this table if OpenTSDB has been configured to track meta-data or the user creates a TSMeta object via the API. Only one column family is used, the ``name`` family and currently there are two types of columns, the meta column and the counter column.

Row Key
-------

This is the same as a data point table row key without the timestamp. E.g. ``<metric_uid><tagk1><tagv1>[...<tagkN><tagvN>]``. It is shared for all column types.

TSMeta Column
-------------

These columns store UTF-8 encoded, JSON formatted objects similar to UIDMeta objects. The qualifier is always ``ts_meta``. Do not modify these column values outside of OpenTSDB or it may break CAS calls.

Counter Column
---------------------

These columns are atomic incrementers that count the number of data points stored for a time series. The qualifier is ``ts_counter`` and the value is an 8 byte signed integer.

Tree Table Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This table behaves as an index, organizing time series into a hierarchical structure similar to a file system for use with tools such as Graphite or other dashboards. A tree is defined by a set of rules that process a TSMeta object to determine where in the hierarchy, if at all, a time series should appear. 

Each tree is assigned a Unique ID consisting of an unsigned integer starting with ``1`` for the first tree. All rows related to a tree are prefixed with this ID encoded as a two byte array. E.g. ``\x00\x01`` for UID ``1``.

Row Key
-------

Tree definition rows are keyed with the ID of the tree on two bytes. Columns pertaining to the tree definition, as well as the root branch, appear in this row. Definitions are generated by the user.

Two special rows may be included. They are keyed on ``<tree ID>\x01`` for the ``collisions`` row and ``<tree ID>\x02`` for the ``not matched`` row. These are generated during tree processing and will be described later.

The remaining rows are branch and leaf rows containing information about the hierarchy. The rows are keyed on ``<tree ID><branch ID>`` where the ``branch ID`` is a concatenation of hashes of the branch display names. For example, if we have a flattened branch ``dal.web01.myapp.bytes_sent`` where each branch name is separated by a period, we would have 3 levels of branching. ``dal``, ``web01`` and ``myapp``. The leaf would be named ``bytes_sent`` and links to a TSUID. Hashing each branch name in Java returns a 4 byte integer and converting to hex for readability yields:

* ``dal`` = \x00\x01\x83\x8F 
* ``web01`` = \x06\xBC\x4C\x55
* ``myapp`` = \x06\x38\x7C\xF5

If this branch belongs to tree ``1``, the row key for ``dal`` would be ``\x00\x01\x00\x01\x83\x8F``. The branch for ``myapp`` would be ``\x00\x01\x00\x01\x83\x8F\x06\xBC\x4C\x55\x06\x38\x7C\xF5``. This schema allows for navigation by providing a row key filter using a prefix including the tree ID and current branch level and a wild-card to match any number of child branch levels (usually only one level down).

Tree Column
-----------

A Tree is defined as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object in the ``tree`` column of a tree row (identified by the tree's ID). The object contains descriptions and configuration settings for processing time series through the tree. Do not modify this object outside of OpenTSDB as it may break CAS calls.

Rule Column
-----------

In the tree row there are 0 or more rule columns that define a specific processing task on a time series. These columns are also UTF-8 encoded JSON objects and are modified with CAS calls. The qualifier id of the format ``rule:<level>:<order>`` where ``<level>`` is the main processing order of a rule in the set (starting at 0) and ``order`` is the processing order of a rule (starting at 0) within a given level. For example ``rule:1:0`` defines a rule at level 1 and order 0.

Tree Collision Column
---------------------

If collision storage is enabled for a tree, a column is recorded for each time series that would have created a leaf that was already created for a previous time series. These columns are used to debug rule sets and only appear in the collision row for a tree. The qualifier is of the format ``tree_collision:<tsuid>`` where the TSUID is a byte array representing the time series identifier. This allows for a simple ``getRequest`` call to determine if a particular time series did not appear in a tree due to a collision. The value of a collision column is the byte array of the TSUID that was recorded as a leaf.

Not Matched Column
------------------

Similar to collisions, when enabled for a tree, a column can be recorded for each time series that failed to match any rules in the rule set and therefore, did not appear in the tree. These columns only appear in the not matched row for a tree. The qualifier is of the format ``tree_not_matched:<TSUID>`` where the TSUID is a byte array representing the time series identifier. The value of a not matched column is the byte array of the TSUID that failed to match a rule.

Branch Column
-------------

Branch columns have the qualifier ``branch`` and contain a UTF-8 JSON encoded object describing the current branch and any child branches that may exist. A branch column may appear in any row except the collision or not matched columns. Branches in the tree definition row are the ``root`` branch and link to the first level of child branches. These links are used to traverse the hierarchy.

Leaf Column
-----------

Leaves are mappings to specific time series and represent the end of a hierarchy. Leaf columns have a qualifier format of ``leaf:<TSUID>`` where the TUID is a byte array representing the time series identifier. The value of a leaf is a UTF-8 encoded JSON object describing the leaf. Leaves may appear in any row other than the collision or not matched rows.
