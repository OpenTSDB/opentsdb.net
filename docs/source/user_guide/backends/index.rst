Storage
=======

OpenTSDB currently supports Apache HBase as its main storage backend. As of version 2.3, OpenTSDB also works with Google's Bigtable in the cloud (fitting as OpenTSDB is descended from a monitoring system at Google and HBase is descended from BigTable). Select the HBase link below to learn about the storage schema or Bigtable to find the configs and setup for use in the cloud.
