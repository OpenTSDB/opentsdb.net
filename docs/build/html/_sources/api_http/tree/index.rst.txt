/api/tree
=========
.. index:: HTTP /api/tree
Trees are meta data used to organize time series in a hierarchical structure for browsing similar to a typical file system. A number of endpoints under the ``/tree`` root allow working with various tree related data:

Tree API Endpoints
------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   branch
   collisions
   notmatched
   rule
   rules
   test
   
The ``/tree`` endpoint allows for creating or modifying a tree definition. Tree definitions include configuration and meta data accessible via this endpoint, as well as the rule set accessiable via ``/tree/rule`` or ``/tree/rules``. 

.. NOTE:: When creating a tree it will have the ``enabled`` field set to ``false`` by default. After creating a tree you should add rules then use the ``tree/test`` endpoint with a few TSUIDs to make sure the resulting tree will be what you expected. After you have verified the results, you can set the ``enabled`` field to ``true`` and new TSMeta objects or a tree synchronization will start to populate branches.

Verbs
-----

* GET - Retrieve one or more tree definitions
* POST - Edit tree fields
* PUT - Replace tree fields
* DELETE - Delete the results of a tree and/or the tree definition

Requests
--------

The following fields can be used for all tree endpoint requests:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Data Type", "Required", "Description", "Default", "QS", "RW", "Example"
   :widths: 10, 5, 5, 45, 10, 5, 5, 15
   
   "treeId", "Integer", "Required*", "Used to fetch or modify a specific tree. *When creating a new tree, the ``tree`` value must not be present.", "", "treeid", "RO", "1"
   "name", "String", "Required*", "A brief, descriptive name for the tree. *Required only when creating a tree.", "", "name", "RW", "Network Infrastructure"
   "description", "String", "Optional", "A longer description of what the tree contains", "", "description", "RW", "Tree containing all network gear"
   "notes", "String", "Optional", "Detailed notes about the tree", "", "notes", "RW", ""
   "strictMatch", "Boolean", "Optional", "Whether or not timeseries should be included in the tree if they fail to match one or more rule levels.", "false", "strict_match", "RW", "true"
   "enabled", "Boolean", "Optional", "Whether or not TSMeta should be processed through the tree. By default this is set to ``false`` so that you can setup rules and test some objects before building branches.", "false", "enabled", "RW", "true"
   "storeFailures", "Boolean", "Optional", "Whether or not collisions and 'not matched' TSUIDs should be recorded. This can create very wide rows.", "false", "store_failures", "RW", "true"
   "definition", "Boolean", "Optional", "Used only when ``DELETE`` ing a tree, if this flag is set to true, then the entire tree definition will be deleted along with all branches, collisions and not matched entries", "false", "definition", "", "true"
   
Response
--------

A successful response to a ``GET``, ``POST`` or ``PUT`` request will return tree objects with optinally requested changes. Successful ``DELETE`` calls will return with a ``204`` status code and no body content. When modifying data, if no changes were present, i.e. the call did not provide any data to store, the resposne will be a ``304`` without any body content. If the requested tree did not exist in the system, a ``404`` will be returned with an error message. If invalid data was supplied an ``400`` error will be returned.

All **Request** fields will be present in the response in addition to others:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Data Type", "Description", "Example"
   :widths: 10, 10, 60, 20
   
   "rules", "Map", "A map or dictionary with rules defined for the tree organized by ``level`` and ``order``. If no rules have been defined yet, the value will be ``null``", "*See Examples*"
   "created", "Integer", "A Unix Epoch timestamp in seconds when the tree was originally created.", "1350425579"

GET
---

A ``GET`` request to ``/api/tree`` without a tree ID will return a list of all of the trees configured in the system. The results will include configured rules for each tree. If no trees have been configured yet, the list will be empty.

To fetch a specific tree, supply a ``treeId' value. The response will include the tree object if found. If the requested tree does not exist, a 404 exception will be returned.

POST/PUT
--------

Using the ``POST`` or ``PUT`` methods, you can create a new tree or edit most of the fields for an existing tree. New trees require a ``name`` value and for the ``treeId' value to be empty. Existing trees require a valid ``treeId`` ID and any fields that require modification. A successful request will return the modified tree object.

.. Note:: A new tree will not have any rules. Your next call should probably be to ``/tree/rule`` or ``/tree/rules``.

  }

DELETE
------

Using the ``DELETE`` method will remove only collisions, not matched entries and branches for the given tree from storage. This endpoint starts a delete. Because the delete can take some time, the endpoint will return a successful 204 response without data if the delete completed. If the tree was not found, it will return a 404. If you want to delete the tree definition itself, you can supply the ``defintion`` flag in the query string with a value of ``true`` and the tree and rule definitions will be removed as well.

.. WARNING:: This method cannot be undone. Once executed, the purge will continue running unless the TSD is shutdown.

.. NOTE:: Before executing a ``DELETE`` query, you should make sure that a manual tree syncronization is not running somehwere on your data. If it is, there may be some orphaned branches or leaves stored during the purge. Use the _____ CLi tool sometime after the delete to cleanup left over branches or leaves.
