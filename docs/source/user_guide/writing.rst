Writing Data
============

You may want to jump right in and start throwing data into your TSD, but to really take advantage of OpenTSDB's power and flexibility, you may want to pause and think about your naming schema. After you've done that, you can procede to pushing data over the Telnet or HTTP APIs, or use an existing tool with OpenTSDB support such as 'tcollector'.

Naming Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many metrics administrators are used to supplying a single name for their time series. For example, systems administrators used to RRD style systems may name their time series ``webserver01.sys.cpu.0.user``. The name tells us that the time series is recording the amount of time in user space for cpu ``0`` on ``webserver01``. This works great if you want to retrieve just the user time for that cpu core on that particular web server later on. 

But what if the web server has 64 cores and you want to get the average time across all of them? Some systems allow you to specify a wild card such as ``webserver01.sys.cpu.*.user`` that would read all 64 files and aggregate the results. Alternatively, you could record a new time series called ``webserver01.sys.cpu.user.all`` that represents the same aggregate but you must now write '64 + 1' different time series. What if you had a thousand web servers and you wanted the average cpu time for all of your servers? You could craft a wild card query like ``*.sys.cpu.*.user`` and the system would open all 64,000 files, aggregate the results and return the data. Or you setup a process to pre-aggregate the data and write it to ``webservers.sys.cpu.user.all``.

OpenTSDB handles things a bit differently by introducing the idea of 'tags'. Each time series still has a 'metric' name, but it's much more generic, something that can be shared by many unique time series. Instead, the uniqueness comes from a combination of tag key/value pairs that allows for flexible queries with very fast aggregations.

.. NOTE:: Every time series in OpenTSDB must have at least one tag.

Take the previous example where the metric was ``webserver01.sys.cpu.0.user``. In OpenTSDB, this may become ``sys.cpu.user host=webserver01, cpu=0``. Now if we want the data for an individual core, we can craft a query like ``sum:sys.cpu.user{host=webserver01,cpu=42}``. If we want all of the cores, we simply drop the cpu tag and ask for ``sum:sys.cpu.user{host=webserver01}``. This will give us the aggregated results for all 64 cores. If we want the results for all 1,000 servers, we simply request ``sum:sys.cpu.user``. The underlying data schema will store all of the ``sys.cpu.user`` time series next to each other so that aggregating the individual values is very fast and efficient. OpenTSDB was designed to make these aggregate queries as fast as possible since most users start out at a high level, then drill down for detailed information.

.. _tag_issues:

While the tagging system is flexible, some problems can arise if you don't understand how the querying side of OpenTSDB, hence the need for some forethought. Take the example query above: ``sum:sys.cpu.user{host=webserver01}``. We recorded 64 unique time series for ``webserver01``, one time series for each of the CPU cores. When we issues that query, all of the time series for metric ``sys.cpu.user`` with the tag ``host=webserver01`` were retrieved, averaged and returned as one series of numbers. Lets say the resulting average was ``50`` for timestamp ``1356998400``. Now we were migrating from another system to OpenTSDB and had a process that pre-aggregated all 64 cores so that we could quickly get the average value and simply wrote a new time series "sys.cpu.user host=webserver01``. If we run the same query, we'll get a value of ``100`` at ``1356998400``. What happened? OpenTSDB aggregated all 64 time series 'and' the pre-aggregated time series to get to that 100. In storage, we would have something like this:
::

  sys.cpu.user host=webserver01        1356998400  50
  sys.cpu.user host=webserver01,cpu=0  1356998400  1
  sys.cpu.user host=webserver01,cpu=1  1356998400  0
  sys.cpu.user host=webserver01,cpu=2  1356998400  2
  sys.cpu.user host=webserver01,cpu=3  1356998400  0
  ...
  sys.cpu.user host=webserver01,cpu=63 1356998400  1
  
OpenTSDB will 'automatically' aggregate 'all' of the time series for the metric in a query if no tags are given. If one or more tags are definied, the aggregate will 'include all' time series that match on that tag, regardless of other tags. With the query ``sum:sys.cpu.user{host=webserver01}``, we would include ``sys.cpu.user host=webserver01,cpu=0`` as well as ``sys.cpu.user host=webserver01,cpu=0,manufacturer=Intel``, ``sys.cpu.user host=webserver01,foo=bar`` and ``sys.cpu.user host=webserver01,cpu=0,datacenter=lax,department=ops``. The moral of this example is: be careful about your naming schema.

While OpenTSDB's aggregations are pretty fast, sometimes they aren't fast enough and you may indeed want to pre-aggregate something. For example, if you have many thousands of hosts, it would take a while to aggregate the CPU time across all of those servers. If you want to record and query just the pre-aggregated value separately, simply use a different metric. For example: ``sys.cpu.user.avg host=webserver01`` or ``sys.cpu.user.sum host=webserver01``. Now you can query the pre-aggregate for just that one server or you could even aggregate the pre-aggregates for all of your servers with ``avg:sys.cpu.user.avg``.

When you design your naming schema, keep these in mind:

* Be consistent with your naming
* Use the same number and type of tags for each metric
* Think about the most common queries you'll be executing
* Think about how you may want to drill down when querying
* Don't use too many tags, keep it to a fairly small number

Data Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every time series data point requires the following data:

* metric - A generic name for the timeseries such as ``sys.cpu.user``, ``stock.quote`` or ``env.probe.temp``.
* timestamp - A Unix/POSIX Epoch timestamp in seconds or milliseconds defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC time.
* value - A numeric value to store at the given timestamp for the time series. This may be an integer or a floating point value.
* tag(s) - A key/value pair consisting of a ``tagk`` (the key) and a ``tagv`` (the value). Each data point must have at least one tag.

Timestamps
----------

Data can be written to OpenTSDB with second or millisecond resolution. When writing to the telnet interface, millisecond timestamps may be of the format ``1364410924250`` where three digits are appended that represent the milliseconds, or ``1364410924.250`` where three digits are placed after a period. Timestamps with more than 13 digits will throw an error, so if your application outputs timestamps with more than three millisecond digits, you must round the value before submitting it. Timestamps sent to the ``/api/put`` endpoint over HTTP must be integers and may not have periods.

Timestamps with second resolution are stored on 2 bytes while millisecond resolution are stored on 4. Thus if you do not need millisecond resolution or all of your data points are on 1 second boundaries, we recommend that you submit timestamps with 10 digits for second resolution so that you can save on storage space. It's also a good idea to avoid mixing second and millisecond timestamps for a given time series. Doing so will slow down queries as iteration across mixed timestamps takes longer than if you only record one type or the other. OpenTSDB will store whatever you give it.

.. NOTE:: Providing millisecond resolution does not necessarily mean that OpenTSDB supports write speeds of 1 data point per millisecond over many time series. While a single TSD may be able to handle a few thousand writes per second, that would only cover a few time series if you're try to store a point every millisecond. Instead OpenTSDB aims to provide greater measurement accuracy and you should generally avoid recording data at such a speed, particularly for long running time series.

.. NOTE:: Data with millisecond resolution can only be extracted via the ``/api/query`` endpoint at this time. See :doc:`query/index` for details.

Metrics and Tags
----------------

The following rules apply to metric and tag values:

* Strings are case sensitive, i.e. "Sys.Cpu.User" will be stored separately from "sys.cpu.user"
* Spaces are not allowed
* Only the following characters are allowed: ``a`` to ``z``, ``A`` to ``Z``, ``0`` to ``9``, ``-``, ``_``, ``.``, ``/`` or Unicode letters (as per the specification)

Metric and tags are not limited in length, though you should try to keep the values fairly short.

Integer Values
--------------

If the value from a ``put`` command is parsed without a decimal point, it will be treated as a signed integer. Currently all integers are stored on 8 bytes with planned support for variable length encoding in the future. This means a data point can have a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive). Integers cannot have commas or any character other than digits and the dash (for negative values). E.g. if you wanted to store the maximum value, it would have to be provided in the form ``9223372036854775807``.

Floating Point Values
---------------------

If the value from a ``put`` command is parsed with a decimal point (represented by a period, ``.``) it will be treated as a floating point value. Currently all floating point values are stored on 4 bytes, single-precision, with planned support for 8 bytes in the future. Floats are stored in IEEE 754 floating-point "single format" with positive and negative value support. Initinite and Not-a-Number values are not supported and will throw an error if supplied to a TSD. See `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point>`_ and the `Java Documentation <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.3>`_ for details.

Ordering
--------

A great feature of OpenTSDB is that you can write data for a given time seriesin any order you want. You're not limited to only storing data later than the last data point you wrote. This means you can start pushing current data from your systems to a TSD and then batch import historical data if you want to. 

.. WARNING:: The only caveat when writing is that you cannot overwrite an existing value with a different value. Writing is idempotent, meaning you can write the value ``42`` at timestamp ``1356998400`` and then write ``42`` again for the same time, nothing bad will happen. However if you try to write ``42.5`` to the same timestamp, the row of data will become invalid (due to vagaries of the underlying schema) and any queries that include that row will throw an exception. Use the ``fsck`` utility to fix the row if this happens.

Input Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are currently three main methods to get data into OpenTSDB: Telnet API, HTTP API and batch import from a file. Alternatively you can use a tool that provides OpenTSDB support, or if you're extremely adventurous, use the Java library. 

.. WARNING:: Don't try to write directly to the underlying storage system, e.g. HBase. Just don't. It'll get messy quickly.

Telnet
------

The easiest way to get started with OpenTSDB is to open up a terminal or telnet client, connect to your TSD and issue a ``put`` command and hit 'enter'. If you are writing a program, simply open a socket, print the string command with a new line and send the packet. The telnet command format is:

::

  put <metric> <timestamp> <value> <tagk1=tagv1[ tagk2=tagv2 ...tagkN=tagvN]>
  
For example:

::

  put sys.cpu.user 1356998400 42.5 host=webserver01 cpu=0
 
Each ``put`` can only send a single data point. Don't forget the newline character, e.g. ``\n`` at the end of your command.

Http API
--------

As of version 2.0, data can be sent over HTTP in formats supported by 'Serializer' plugins. Multiple, un-related data points can be sent in a single HTTP POST request to save bandwidth. See the :doc:`../api_http/put` for details.

Batch Import
------------

If you are importing data from another system or you need to backfill historical data, you can use the ``import`` CLI utility. See :doc:`cli/import` for details.

Write Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenTSDB can scale to writing millions of data points per 'second' on commodity servers with regular spinning hard drives. However users who fire up a VM with HBase in stand-alone mode and try to slam millions of data points at a brand new TSD are disappointed when they can only write data in the hundreds of points per second. Here's what you need to do to scale for brand new installs or testing and for expanding existing systems.

UID Assignment
--------------

The first sticking point folks run into is ''uid assignment''. Every string for a metric, tag key and tag value must be assigned a UID before the data point can be stored. For example, the metric ``sys.cpu.user`` may be assigned a UID of ``000001`` the first time it is encountered by a TSD. This assignment takes a fair amount of time as it must fetch an available UID, write a UID to name mapping and a name to UID mapping, then use the UID to write the data point's row key. The UID will be stored in the TSD's cache so that the next time the same metric comes through, it can find the UID very quickly.

Therefore, we recommend that you 'pre-assign' uids to as many metrics, tag keys and tag values as you can. If you have designed a naming schema as recommended above, you'll know most of the values to assign. You can use the CLI tools :doc:`cli/mkmetric`, :doc:`cli/uid` or the HTTP API :doc:`../api_http/uid/index` to perform pre-assignments. Any time you are about to send a bunch of new metrics or tags to a running OpenTSDB cluster, try to pre-assign or the TSDs will bog down a bit when they get the new data.

.. NOTE:: If you restart a TSD, it will have to lookup the UID for every metric and tag so performance will be a little slow until the cache is filled.

Pre-Split HBase Regions
-----------------------

For brand new installs you will see much better performance if you pre-split the regions in HBase regardless of if you're testing on a stand-alone server or running a full cluster. HBase regions handle a defined range of row keys and are essentially a single file. When you create the ``tsdb`` table and start writing data for the first time, all of those data points are being sent to this one file on one server. As a region fills up, HBase will automatically split it into different files and move it to other servers in the cluster, but when this happens, the TSDs cannot write to the region and must buffer the data points. Therefore, if you can pre-allocate a number of regions before you start writing, the TSDs can send data to multiple files or servers and you'll be taking advantage of the linear scalability immediately. 

A simplest way to pre-split your ``tsdb`` table regions is to estimate the number of unique metric names you'll be recording. If you have designed a naming schema, you should have a pretty good idea. Lets say we'll track 4,000 metrics in our system. That's not to say 4,000 time series, as we're not counting the tags yet, just the metric names such as "sys.cpu.user". Data points are written in row keys where the metric's UID comprises the first bytes, 3 bytes by default. The first metric will be assigned a UID of ``000001`` as a hex encoded value. The 4,000th metric will have a UID of ``000FA0`` in hex. You can use these as the start and end keys in the script from the `HBase Book <http://hbase.apache.org/book/perf.writing.html>`_ to split your table into any number of regions. 256 regions may be a good place to start depending on how many time series share each metric.

TODO - include scripts for pre-splitting.

The simple split method above assumes that you have roughly an equal number of time series per metric (i.e. a fairly consistent cardinality). E.g. the metric with a UID of ``000001`` may have 200 time series and ``000FA0`` has about 150. If you have a wide range of time series per metric, e.g. ``000001`` has 10,000 time series while ``000FA0`` only has 2, you may need to develop a more complex splitting algorithm.

But don't worry too much about splitting. As stated above, HBase will automatically split regions for you so over time, the data will be distributed fairly evenly.

Distributed HBase
-----------------

HBase will run in stand-alone mode where it will use the local file system for storing files. It will still use multiple regions and perform as well as the underlying disk or raid array will let it. You'll definitely want a RAID array under HBase so that if a drive fails, you can replace it without losing data. This kind of setup is fine for testing or very small installations and you should be able to get into the low thousands of data points per second.

However if you want serious throughput and scalability you have to setup a Hadoop and HBase cluster with multiple servers. In a distributed setup HDFS manages region files, automatically distributing copies to different servers for fault tolerance. HBase assigns regions to different servers and OpenTSDB's client will send data points to the specific server where they will be stored. You're now spreading operations amongst multiple servers, increasing performance and storage. If you need even more throughput or storage, just add nodes or disks.

There are a number of ways to setup a Hadoop/HBase cluster and a ton of various tuning tweaks to make, so Google around and ask user groups for advice. Some general recomendations include:

* Dedicate a pair of high memory, low disk space servers for the Name Node. Set them up for high availability using something like Heartbeat and Pacemaker.
* Setup Zookeeper on at least 3 servers for fault tolerance. They must have a lot of RAM and a fairly fast disk for log writing. On small clusters, these can run on the Name node servers.
* JBOD for the HDFS data nodes
* HBase region servers can be collocated with the HDFS data nodes
* At least 1 gbps links between servers, 10 gbps preferable.
* Keep the cluster in a single data center

Multiple TSDs
-------------

A single TSD can handle thousands of writes per second. But if you have many sources it's best to scale by running multiple TSDs and using a load balancer (such as Varnish or DNS round robin) to distribute the writes. Many users colocate TSDs on their HBase region servers when the cluster is dedicated to OpenTSDB. 

Persistent Connections
----------------------

Enable keep alives in the TSDs and make sure that any applications you are using to send time series data keep their connections open instead of opening and closing for every write. See :doc:`configuration` for details.

Disable Meta Data and Real Time Publishing
------------------------------------------

OpenTSDB 2.0 introduced meta data for tracking the kinds of data in the system. When tracking is enabled, a counter is incremented for every data point written and new UIDs or time series will generate meta data. The data may be pushed to a search engine or passed through tree generation code. These processes require greater memory in the TSD and may affect throughput. Tracking is disabled by default so test it out before enabling the feature.

2.0 also introduced a real-time publishing plugin where incoming data points can be emitted to another destination immediately after they're queued for storage. This is diabled by default so test any plugins you are interested in before deploying in production.
