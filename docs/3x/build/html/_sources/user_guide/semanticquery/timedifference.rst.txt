 Time Difference
===============
.. index:: timedifference
Computes the delta between data point time stamps. E.g. if one data point is at 11:05 and the second at 11:10 the difference reported would be 300 seconds (with a resolution of seconds). Only data points with a numeric value are considered, the node will skip over ``NaN`` and ``null`` values.

It is best to process raw data with this node as downsampled or interpolated data may be filled and not reflect the actual time deltas.

Fields include:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Data Type", "Required", "Description", "Default", "Example"
   :widths: 10, 5, 5, 45, 10, 25
   
   "resolution", "String", "Optional", "The resolution used to report the timestamp delta.", "SECONDS", "MILLIS"
      
Potential values for the resolution string include:

* HOURS
* MINUTES
* SECONDS
* MILLIS
* NANOS

They come from the Java ``ChronoUnit`` enumeration.

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    "id": "diff",
    "type": "TimeDifference",
    "sources": ["m1"],
    "resolution": "SECONDS"
  }
